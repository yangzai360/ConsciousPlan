[项目简介](https://www.jianshu.com/p/518f22dce9d2)

「Conscious plan App」是我自己构思，自己做 UI 设计和代码开发的 iOS 本地的个人计划管理软件。

基于 **Swift 3**，本地持久化使用 **Core Data**。（已迁移 Swift 5）

「Conscious plan App」是一款帮助你记录、管理与追踪个人计划的 App。

在「Conscious plan App」中，你可以创建自己的定量计划，可以增加与删除计划的进度，可以查看定量计划的进度。

还可以创建 ToDo 计划，新增或标记完成 ToDo 计划的子计划。

还有日历视图可以查看过去的日子里自己在做什么。

后去参与创业，许久没更新，已从 App Store 下架。

代码仓库开源至此。但是因使用的Swift 3.X版本，故无任何参考学习意义，仅作为个人留念。（另外，在dev分支中更新到了swift5.0版本，可正常运行。）

[Project brief](https://www.jianshu.com/p/518f22dce9d2)

"Consistent plan app" is a local personal plan management software for IOS, which I designed and developed by myself.

Based on swift 3, core data is used for local persistence. (swift 5 migrated)

Consistent plan app is an app that helps you record, manage and track your personal plans.

In the "consistent plan app", you can create your own quantitative plan, add and delete the progress of the plan, and view the progress of the quantitative plan.

You can also create todo plans, add or mark sub plans to complete todo plans.

There is also a calendar view to see what you've been doing in the past.

After that, I went to start a business. I haven't updated it for a long time, and I have been removed from the app store.

The code warehouse is open source. However, due to the use of swift 3. X version, there is no reference learning significance, just as a personal memento. (in addition, the dev branch is updated to swift version 5.0, which can work normally.)
